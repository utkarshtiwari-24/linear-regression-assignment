> Various ML techniques such as Linear Regressions and others were applied to analyze and predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the BoomBikes to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. This model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
